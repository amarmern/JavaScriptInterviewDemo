What is Node.js? What is it used for?
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment and library to run web applications outside the clientâ€™s browser. It is used to create server-side web applications. Node.js is perfect for data-intensive applications as it uses an
 asynchronous, event-driven model1. 


What are the benefits of Node.js?
Some of the benefits of using Node.js include that it is generally fast, rarely blocks, offers a unified programming language and data type, everything is asynchronous, and it yields great concurrency1. 


How does Node.js work?
A web server using Node.js typically has a workflow that is quite similar to the diagram illustrated below. Clients send requests to the webserver to interact with the web application. Requests can be non-blocking or blocking. Node.js retrieves the incoming
 requests and adds those to the Event Queue. The requests are then passed one-by-one through the Event Loop. It checks if the requests are simple enough not to require any external resources. The Event Loop processes simple requests (non-blocking operations),
 such as I/O Polling, and returns the responses to the corresponding clients2. 


What is event-driven programming?
Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of program execution is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs, or messages from other programs or threads1. 


What is an event loop in Node.js? The event loop in Node.js is a mechanism that allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O
 operations by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible. The event loop runs in a single thread and is responsible for managing callbacks for asynchronous operations1. 


How does Node.js handle child threads?
Node.js does not natively support multithreading, but it does provide support for child processes, which can be used to achieve similar functionality. The child_process module in Node.js provides several methods for spawning new processes and managing inter-process
 communication3. 


What are the types of API functions in Node.js? There are two types of API functions in Node.js: blocking and non-blocking.
 Blocking functions execute synchronously and block further execution until they complete, while non-blocking functions execute asynchronously and do not block further execution1. 


What is your experience with Node.js?
This question will vary depending on the individual being interviewed. 


Why use Node.js? Node.js makes building scalable network programs easy. Some of its advantages include that it is generally
 fast, rarely blocks, offers a unified programming language and data type, everything is asynchronous, and it yields great concurrency2. 


What is Node.js mostly used for?
Node.js can be used for developing real-time web applications, network applications, general-purpose applications, and distributed systems1. It is also commonly used for building back-end services such as APIs.
